I learned quite a much in this course. The course touched on automating the software testing, deployment and delivery and much more and I was happy to learn specifically about those subjects.
For me Agile methods and theory are quite familiar as I have read about them in some extent but all additional information about actual practicalities of software development are intresting to me. 
But I really learn the best when I am actually doing something and aside from theory this course gave a chance to do a small project. (which was main reason I took the course)
As I touched on the matter of how I have not done actual work with countinuous integration tools in the last blog post, this course provided a opportunity to learn about it. Quite frankly it was a hoot, hugo platform, Travis CI, GitHub pages are really nice to work with and really really fast way to publish a website. What I have learned here I will definately use in the future. What I'd like to to next is to have my own domain but that's to come.

During this course I found the theory parts to be the easiest and actually the project to be the highlight and more challenging. I'd actually add to it and make the advanced project a little bit more challenging altough maybe it's not the point of this course as it's only a small and tightly packed course.

If I'd be asked to take a advanced course about this subject I'd definately take it.
