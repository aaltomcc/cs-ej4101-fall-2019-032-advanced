I learned about this course from a friend and they recommended to take it. I reaserched about it a little bit from oodi and decided to start this course as it seemed really intresting.
My motivation for taking this course and wanting to learn about DevOps is coming from my intrest in software development and computer science in general.

From the course I wanted to learn more about DevOps in practice and also really do somekind of project related to it. This was my first touch with a Continuous Integration software like travis and I was pleased to learn how to use it and actually how easy it is to use, atleast the basics :)

Using Hugo was also a first for me. I really did not know that setting up a simple website is so easy. I recon that these king of sites are useful for blogs, personal resume sites and such.
This course also introduces Git version control but that is familiar for me as I use it almost daily.

What comes to the theory about DevOps I really wanted to know what it really means. I expected this course to teach what form DevOps and what it contains and what is considered DevOps and what is not. I also wanted to learn about the terminology and such which is useful to know in worklife.

All in all even though this is not a deep diving course into DevOps it seemed as a nice introduction to practises used in software engineering.
