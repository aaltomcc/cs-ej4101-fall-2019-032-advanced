My University journey started with electric engineering and while it is quite interesting once I was introduced to programming (altough it was C and I first flunked it) it really grasped me from the start. I realized that so much can be achieved via programming and that only your imagination is really the limit. The feeling of accomplishment when figuring out a unique solution to problem is quite extatic.
And with coding comes the practises of coding: version control, efficient ways of development and deployment, testing the code and so on. All this is also interesting and figuring out new more efficient or better ways to produce your own code is the best feeling!
