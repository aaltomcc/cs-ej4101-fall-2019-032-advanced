      <description>My University journey started with electric engineering and while it is quite interesting once I was introduced to programming (altough it was C and I first flunked it) it really grasped me from the start. I realized that so much can be achieved via programming and that only your imagination is really the limit. The feeling of accomplishment when figuring out a unique solution to problem is quite extatic. And with coding comes the practises of coding: version control, efficient ways of development and deployment, testing the code and so on.</description>
